# Bede Gaming Developer Test
As a way for Bede Gaming to get to know a developers skills, they ask you to do a simple task with some deliverables, please see [bref.md](bref.md)

## Setup
To setup this project, please run the following command in a terminal `composer install && vagrant up`.  
  
This will install all composer dependencies, then start a homestead vagrant box and finish off installation with database migrations etc.

## Tests
At this moment there aren't any, I wish to learn TDD etc. but haven't had a chance to use it in a work environment, and at home I tend to hack more than produce production read code 1st time.
